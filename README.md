MERN stack project with CRUD operations, data validation, TypeScript, and TanStack Query.

A user can view a list of books fetched with TanStack Query on the Frontend. Users can also add and delete books as well as view specific info about a single book.

Although it has "Bookstore" in the title, my project doesnt have the ability to add books to a cart and purchase them yet. But I plan to add a fake buying feature. I also want to add authentication with Clerk.
