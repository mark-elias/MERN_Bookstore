Made With:
- MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, TypeScript, Zod, Joi, TanStack Query, REST API, Tailwind, Git

Description:
- MERN stack project with CRUD operations, data validation, TypeScript, and TanStack Query. A user can view a list of books fetched with TanStack Query on the Frontend. Users can also add and delete books as well as view specific info about a single book. Although it has "Bookstore" in the title, my project doesnt have the ability to add books to a cart and purchase them yet.

Future Updates:
- I want to add Authentication with Clerk
- I want to implement a fake book purchasing feature where users can actually add books to a cart and purchase them.
- I want to show the info for the specific book being edited when a user goes to the Edit page.
